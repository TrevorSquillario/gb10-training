# Lesson 6: "Vibe Coding" & Real-Time IDE Integration

**Objective:** Master Vibe Coding—a style of development where you stay in the "flow" by using natural language and real-time AI suggestions. Configure Continue.dev to use your GB10 as a local power source for autocomplete and chat.

## 1. What is "Vibe Coding"?

Vibe coding is the transition from manually typing every line to curating code generated by the AI. On the GB10, this is superior to cloud-based tools (like Copilot) for two reasons:

- **Zero Data Leakage:** Your proprietary code never leaves the GB10.
- **Large Context Awareness:** You can feed the AI your entire local folder structure, which the GB10 can process instantly thanks to the Grace-Blackwell high-speed interconnect.

### Top open weights coding models

YMMV on these models but they are worth trying out.

To add these to Ollama in your terminal, run:

```bash
docker exec -it ollama ollama pull qwen3-coder-next
docker exec -it ollama ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:32b
docker exec -it ollama ollama pull gpt-oss:120b
docker exec -it ollama ollama pull llama3.3:70b
```

unsloth has a lot of GGUF based releases of coding models https://huggingface.co/unsloth/models
```bash
docker exec -it ollama ollama pull hf.co/unsloth/gemma-3-27b-it-GGUF
```

## Hands-on Lab: Configuring Cline

1. Go to the Extensions view (`Ctrl + Shift + X`) and install **Cline**.
2. Click the Cline icon on the left bar and drag it to the right Chat panel if you'd prefer.
3. Click the gear icon at the top of the Cline sidebar. Select API Configuration
```
API Provider: ollama
Use custom base URL: http://192.168.0.30:11434
Model: Select a model
```
4. Follow a similar process for **Roo Code** if you want to try that extension as well. Compare them and see which you prefer. 

## Review of Extensions

None of the VSCode extensions are even close to Github Copilot but that was kind of expected. I think with time these open source extensions will improve.

Review of current VSCode extensions:

- Claude Code: Terminal only, works well
- Cline: Works okay but limited features
- Continue.dev: Lots of mention of this on the Internets but I couldn't get it to work properly with any models besides Llama3.
- Github Copilot: Ollama integration doesn't work, the models are populated but chats fail. There is a free tier for Cloud models. The subscription is $100/year and well worth it if you code a lot.
- Roo Code: Works okay, need to test more. This is a fork of Cline with more features. 

These are separate IDEs that have better support for AI coding assistants:

- Zed is a local-first code editor with AI built-in: https://zed.dev/
- Codeium is another AI coding assistant that can be self-hosted: https://codeium.com/

## Hands-on Lab: Vibe Coding Techniques

Now that it's set up, practice the three core "Vibes":

- **The Ghost Write (Tab):** Create a new `test.py` file. Start typing a function like `def calculate_sales_tax(amount):`. Wait 500ms. The GB10 will suggest the entire function in gray text. Press Tab to accept.
- **The Highlight (Cmd+L / Ctrl+L):** Highlight a block of code and press `Ctrl+L`. Ask: "Refactor this to be more efficient using a list comprehension."
- **The Intent (Cmd+I / Ctrl+I):** Press `Ctrl+I` to open the "Edit" box. Type: "Add a docstring to every function in this file." Watch as the GB10 edits the file in real-time.

🌟 **Lesson 6 Challenge: The "No-Keyboard" Component**

**Task:** Create a new React or HTML component without "writing" any logic manually.

1. Create a blank file `Dashboard.html`.
2. Use `Ctrl+I` to say: "Build me a sales dashboard with a dark theme, a header, and a table showing 5 dummy products using Tailwind CSS."
3. Use `Ctrl+L` on the resulting table to say: "Add a 'Status' column that randomly displays 'Paid' or 'Pending' with green/yellow badges."

**Goal:** See how far you can get by only describing the "vibe" of the UI.
