# Session 6: "Vibe Coding" & Real-Time IDE Integration

**Objective:** Master Vibe Coding—a style of development where you stay in the "flow" by using natural language and real-time AI suggestions. Configure Continue.dev to use your GB10 as a local power source for autocomplete and chat.

## 1. What is "Vibe Coding"?

Vibe coding is the transition from manually typing every line to curating code generated by the AI. On the GB10, this is superior to cloud-based tools (like Copilot) for two reasons:

- **Zero Data Leakage:** Your proprietary code never leaves the GB10.
- **Large Context Awareness:** You can feed the AI your entire local folder structure, which the GB10 can process instantly thanks to the Grace-Blackwell high-speed interconnect.

## 2. Hands-on Lab: Configuring Continue.dev

Since your GB10 is already running Ollama (from Session 4), we just need to "plug in" VS Code.

### Step A: Extension install

Open VS Code on your laptop (connected via Remote-SSH to the GB10).

Go to the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`) and install **Continue**.

### Step B: Configuring the config.json

Click the gear icon at the bottom of the Continue sidebar to open your configuration. We will set up two models: one for Chat (Deep & Smart) and one for Autocomplete (Small & Fast).

Replace the file contents with this structure:

```json
{
  "models": [
    {
      "title": "GB10 Chat (Qwen 32B)",
      "provider": "ollama",
      "model": "qwen3-coder:32b",
      "apiBase": "http://localhost:11434"
    }
  ],
  "tabAutocompleteModel": {
    "title": "GB10 Autocomplete (1.5B)",
    "provider": "ollama",
    "model": "qwen3-coder:1.5b",
    "apiBase": "http://localhost:11434"
  },
  "tabAutocompleteOptions": {
    "multilineCompletions": "always"
  }
}
```

### Step C: Pulling the "fast" model

Autocomplete needs to be nearly instant. We use the 1.5B version of Qwen3 for this because it can reside permanently in a tiny corner of the GB10's 128GB memory.

In your terminal, run:

```bash
ollama pull qwen3-coder:1.5b
```

## 3. Vibe Coding Techniques

Now that it's set up, practice the three core "Vibes":

- **The Ghost Write (Tab):** Start typing a function like `def calculate_sales_tax(amount):`. Wait 500ms. The GB10 will suggest the entire function in gray text. Press Tab to accept.
- **The Highlight (Cmd+L / Ctrl+L):** Highlight a block of code and press `Ctrl+L`. Ask: "Refactor this to be more efficient using a list comprehension."
- **The Intent (Cmd+I / Ctrl+I):** Press `Ctrl+I` to open the "Edit" box. Type: "Add a docstring to every function in this file." Watch as the GB10 edits the file in real-time.

🌟 **Session 6 Challenge: The "No-Keyboard" Component**

**Task:** Create a new React or HTML component without "writing" any logic manually.

1. Create a blank file `Dashboard.html`.
2. Use `Ctrl+I` to say: "Build me a sales dashboard with a dark theme, a header, and a table showing 5 dummy products using Tailwind CSS."
3. Use `Ctrl+L` on the resulting table to say: "Add a 'Status' column that randomly displays 'Paid' or 'Pending' with green/yellow badges."

**Goal:** See how far you can get by only describing the "vibe" of the UI.

> **Pro Tip:** If the autocomplete feels sluggish, it's usually because the 1GbE network latency (between your laptop and the GB10) is higher than the AI's generation time. For the snappiest experience, ensure you are on a wired connection rather than Wi-Fi.
